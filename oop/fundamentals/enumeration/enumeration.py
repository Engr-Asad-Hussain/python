""" Introduction to the Python Enumeration """

# By definition, an enumeration is a set of members that have associated unique constant values. 
# Enumeration is often called enum.

from enum import Enum
class Color(Enum):
    RED = 1
    GREEN = 2
    BLUE = 3
    
# Note that the enumerationâ€™s members are constants. Therefore, their names are in uppercase letters 
# by convention.
# In this example, the Color is an enumeration. The RED, GREEN, and BLUE are members of the Color 
# enumeration. They have associated values 1, 2, and 3.

print(type(Color))      # <class 'enum.EnumMeta'>
print(type(Color.RED))  # <enum 'Color'>
print(isinstance(Color.RED, Color)) # True
print(isinstance(Color.RED, Enum))  # True

# And it has the name and value attributes:
print(Color.RED.name, type(Color.RED.name))
print(Color.RED.value)

""" Membership and equality """
# To check if a member is in an enumeration, you use the in operator
if Color.RED in Color:
    print('RED is the member of Enum Color')
    
""" Access an enumeration member by name and value """
print(Color.RED, type(Color.RED))
print(Color['RED'], type(Color['RED']))

# Since an enumeration is callable, you can get a member by its value. 
# For example, the following return the RED member of the Color enumeration by its value:
print(Color(1))
print(Color(2))

""" Iterate enumeration members """
for color in Color:
    print('color', color)
    
# Also, you can use the list() function to return a list of members from an enumeration:
print(list(Color))

""" Enumerations are immutable """
# Enumerations are immutable. 
# It means you cannot add or remove members once an enumeration is defined. 
# And you also cannot change the member values.

# Color['ORANGE'] = 4 # TypeError

""" Python enumeration example """
class ResponseStatus(Enum):
    PENDING = 'pending'
    FULFILLED = 'fulfilled'
    REJECTED = 'rejected'
    
""" Summary """
# An enumeration is a set of members that have associated unique constant values.
# Create a new enumeration by defining a class that inherits from the Enum type of the enum module.
# The members have the same types as the enumeration to which they belong.
# Use the enumeration[member_name] to access a member by its name and enumeration(member_value) to 
# access a member by its value.
# Enumerations are iterable.
# Enumeration members are hashable. It means we can use enums as the dict key.
# Enumerable are immuable.
# Cannot inherits from an enumeration unless it has no members"""
