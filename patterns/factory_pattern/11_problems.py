## Problems:

# 1. Complex logical code uses if/elif/else structures to change the
# behavior of an application. Using if/elif/else conditional structures
# makes the code harder to read, harder to understand, and harder to maintain.

# 2. The single responsibility principle states that a module, a class,
# or even a method should have a single responsibility. It should do just
# one thing and have only one reason to change. The .serialize() method
# in SongSerializer will require changes for many different reasons.
# This increases the risk of introducing new defects or breaking existing
# functionality when changes are made. Letâ€™s take a look at all the
# situations that will require modifications to the implementation:
#    - When a new format is introduced: The method will have to change to
#       implement the serialization to that format.
#    - When the Song object changes: Adding or removing properties to the
#       Song class will require the implementation to change in order to
#       accommodate the new structure.
#    - When the string representation for a format changes (plain JSON vs
#       JSON API): The .serialize() method will have to change if the
#       desired string representation for a format changes because the
#       representation is hard-coded in the .serialize() method implementation.

# The ideal situation would be if any of those changes in requirements
# could be implemented without changing the .serialize() method.
