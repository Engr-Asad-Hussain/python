## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort
- Comparison based algorithm
- Each pair of adjacemt elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.
- Time complexity `O(nÂ²)`
- [Example](./XX1_bubble_sort_algorithm.py)

## Insertion Sort
- Comparison based algorithm
- Insertion Sort works the same way you might sort playing cards in your hands:
  - Start with one card (element),
  - Pick the next card and insert it into the correct position relative to the sorted part.
- Time complexity `O(nÂ²)`
- [Example](./XX2_insertion_sort.py)

## Selection Sort
- Comparison based algorithm
- Works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the sorted part.
  - Find the smallest item and put it at the front.
  - Then find the next smallest and place it after the first.
  - Repeat until the list is sorted.
- Time complexity `O(nÂ²)`
- [Example](./XX3_selection_sort.py)



####
ðŸ”¹ Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms
Efficient (Divide and Conquer) Sorts
Merge Sort â€“ Stable, O(n log n)

Quick Sort â€“ Unstable, O(n log n) avg

Heap Sort â€“ Unstable, O(n log n)

Other Comparison-Based Sorts
Shell Sort â€“ An optimization of insertion sort

TimSort â€“ Hybrid of merge sort + insertion sort (used in Python/Java)

Tree Sort â€“ Uses binary search tree (BST)

Smooth Sort â€“ Based on a heap-like structure

Comb Sort â€“ Improves bubble sort

Gnome Sort â€“ Similar to insertion but swaps like bubble

Cocktail Shaker Sort â€“ Bidirectional bubble sort

Stooge Sort â€“ Inefficient, academic

ðŸ”¹ Non-Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms
These don't use comparisons and can achieve O(n) time under certain conditions:

Counting Sort â€“ Best for small integer ranges

Radix Sort â€“ For numbers/strings, sorts digit by digit

Bucket Sort â€“ Distributes input into buckets, then sorts

Pigeonhole Sort â€“ Like counting sort, for known ranges

Flash Sort â€“ Combines distribution and partitioning

ðŸ”¹ Parallel & External Sorting (Advanced)
Bitonic Sort â€“ Used in parallel computing

Odd-Even Sort (Brick Sort) â€“ Parallel-friendly

External Merge Sort â€“ For huge datasets (disk-based)
